In this lab, you will learn the basics of multi-threaded programming, and synchronizing multiple threads using locks and condition variables. You will use the pthreads thread API in this assignment.

Before you begin

Please familiarize yourself with the pthreads API thoroughly. Many helpful tutorials and sample programs are available online. Practice writing simple programs with multiple threads, using locks and condition variables for synchronization across threads. Some example programs for you to write are:

Part A: Master-Worker Thread Pool

In this part of the lab, you will implement a simple master and worker thread pool, a pattern that occurs in many real life applications. The master threads produce numbers continuously and place them in a buffer, and worker threads will consume them, i.e., print these numbers to the screen. This simple program is an example of a master-worker thread pool pattern that is commonly found in several reallife application servers. For example, in the commonly used multi-threaded architecture for web servers, the server has one or more master threads and a pool of worker threads. When a new connection arrives from a web client, the master accepts the request and hands it over to one of the workers. The worker then reads the web request from the network socket and writes a response back to the client. Your simple master-worker program is similar in structure to such applications, albeit with much simpler request processing logic at the application layer.

You are given a skeleton program master-worker-skeleton.c. This program takes 4 command line arguments: how many numbers to ‚Äúproduce‚Äù (M), the maximum size of the buffer in which the produced numbers should be stored (N), the number of worker threads to consume these numbers (C), and the number of master threads to produce numbers (P). The skeleton code spawns P master threads, that produce the specified number of integers from 0 to M ‚àí1 into a shared buffer array. The main program waits for these threads to join, and then terminates. The skeleton code given to you does not have any logic for synchronization.

You must write your solution in the file master-worker.c. You must modify this skeleton code in the following ways. You must add code to spawn the required number of worker threads, and write the function to be run by these threads. This function will remove/consume items from the shared buffer and print them to screen. Further, you must add logic to correctly synchronize the producer and consumer threads in such a way that every number is produced and consumed exactly once. Further, producers must not try to produce when the buffer is full, and consumers should not consume from an empty buffer. While you need to ensure that all C workers are involved in consuming the integers, it is not necessary to ensure perfect load balancing between the workers. Once all M integers (from 0 to M ‚àí1) have been produced and consumed, all threads must exit. The main thread must call pthreadjoin on the master and worker threads, and terminate itself once all threads have joined. Your solution must only use pthreads condition variables for waiting and signaling: busy waiting is not allowed.

Your code can be compiled as shown below. gcc master-worker.c -lpthread

If your code is written correctly, every integer from 0 to M ‚àí1 will be produced exactly once by the master producer thread, and consumed exactly once by the worker consumer threads. We have provided you with a simple testing script (test-master-worker.sh which invokes the script check.awk) that checks this above invariant on the output produced by your program. The script relies on the two print functions that must be invoked by the producer and consumer threads: the master thread must call the function printproduced when it produces an integer into the buffer, and the worker threads must call the function printconsumed when it removes an integer from the buffer to consume. You must invoke these functions suitably in your solution. Please do not modify these print functions, as their output will be parsed by the testing script.

Part B: Reader-Writer Locks

In this part of the lab, you must implement both flavors of the reader-writer lock. You must complete the definition of the structure that captures the reader-writer lock in rwlock.h. The following functions to be supported by this lock are also defined in the header file:

‚Ä¢ The function InitalizeReadWriteLock() must initialize the lock suitably.

‚Ä¢ The function ReaderLock() is invoked by a reader thread before entering a read-only critical section, and the function ReaderUnlock() is invoked by the reader when exiting the critical section.

‚Ä¢ The function WriterLock() is invoked by a writer thread before entering a critical section with shared data updates, and the function WriterUnlock() is invoked by the writer when exiting the critical section.

Part C: Semaphores using pthreads

In this part of the lab, you will implement the synchronization functionality of semaphores using pthreads mutexes and condition variables. Let‚Äôs call these new userspace semaphores that you implement as zemaphores, to avoid confusing them with semaphores provided by the Linux kernel. You must define your zemaphore structure in the file zemaphore.h, and implement the functions zeminit, zemup and zem down that operate on this structure in the file zemaphore.c. The semantics of these zemaphore functions are similar to those of the semaphores you have studied in class.

‚Ä¢ The function zem init initializes the specified zemaphore to the specified value.

‚Ä¢ The function zemup increments the counter value of the zemaphore by one, and wakes up any one sleeping thread.

‚Ä¢ The function zemdown decrements the counter value of the zemaphore by one. If the value is negative, the thread blocks and is context switched out, to be woken up by an up operation on the zemaphore at a later point.

Once you implement your zemaphores, you can use the program test-zem.c to test your implementation. This program spawns two threads, and all three threads (the main thread and the two new threads) share a zemaphore. Before you implement the zemaphore logic, the new threads will print to screen before the main thread. However, after you implement the zemaphore correctly, the main thread will print first, owing to the synchronization enabled by the zemaphore. You must not modify this test program in any way, but only use it to test your zemaphore implementation.

Next, you are given a simple program with three threads in test-toggle.c. In its current form, the three threads will all print to screen in any order. Modify this program in such a way that the print statements of the threads are interleaved in the order thread0, thread1, thread2, thread0, thread1, thread2, ‚Ä¶ and so on. You must only use your zemaphores to achieve this synchronization between the threads. You must not directly use the mutexes and condition variables of the pthreads library in the file test-toggle.c.

The script test-zem.sh will compile and run these test programs for you and can be used for testing.

Submission instructions

‚Ä¢ For part A, you must submit master-worker.c. For part B, you must submit rwlock.h, rwlock-reader-pref.cpp, and rwlock-writer-pref.cpp. For part C, you will submit zemaphore.h, zemaphore.c, test-toggle.c.

‚Ä¢ Place these files and any other files you wish to submit in your submission directory, with the directory name being your roll number (say, 12345678).

‚Ä¢ Tar and gzip the directory using the command tar -zcvf 12345678.tar.gz 12345678 to produce a single compressed file of your submission directory. Submit this tar gzipped file on Moodle.

Grading

We will check correctness of your code using the test scripts provided (with additional test cases beyond those provided to you). In addition to using the test scripts, we will also read through your code to ensure that you have adhered to the problem specification in your implementation.
